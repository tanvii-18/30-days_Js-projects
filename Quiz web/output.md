Quiz Web Application
This is a simple and interactive quiz web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides an engaging way to test your knowledge through multiple-choice questions and displays the score at the end of the quiz.

Features:
Timer: The quiz comes with a countdown timer that limits the time available to answer each question.

Score Calculation: Your score is calculated based on the number of correct answers.

Answer Highlighting: After the user selects an option, the selected answer is highlighted in green (correct) or red (wrong), and the correct answer is shown in green.

Quiz Navigation: Users can move through questions and see the results at the end.

Technologies Used:
HTML5: Structure of the quiz web page.

CSS3: Styling and layout of the page.

JavaScript/jQuery: Used to handle quiz logic, timer, option selection, and score calculation.

How It Works:
The user is presented with a question and multiple-choice options.

After selecting an option, the answer is checked and highlighted in green (if correct) or red (if wrong).

After completing all questions or when the timer runs out, the final score is displayed.

The quiz is fully interactive and disables further clicking once an option is selected.
